# About me


Example text, *italics* and **bold**
in markdown line breaks are ignored
so content like this will render all as one paragraph  
unless there are two spaces at the end (like the line above)

[links look like this](with/the/url/here) for example: see more examples in the [myst markdown syntax cheatsheet](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html)

## subheading example

- starting lines like this
- makes them into a bulleted 
- list when your page builds
